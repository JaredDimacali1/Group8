    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The UWT Cloud Security Project aims to demonstrate a practical implementation of secure cloud
      infrastructure for enterprise and educational use. Our simulated environment represents a modern
      IT organization managing data across hybrid cloud systems — AWS and Azure.
    </p>
    <p>
      By combining virtualization, network segmentation, and authentication protocols, the project provides
      students with hands-on experience designing, deploying, and securing multi-tier systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Infrastructure Overview</h2>
    <p>
      We utilize AWS EC2 for compute resources and S3 for storage and static hosting. A load balancer
      (HAProxy) distributes traffic evenly between redundant web servers. Snort monitors network activity
      to detect potential threats, while IDS/IPS systems actively prevent intrusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shibboleth SSO integrates secure authentication, ensuring users are verified before accessing sensitive data.
    </p>

    <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      The development process followed a real-world enterprise workflow, starting with
      infrastructure planning and ending with security validation and monitoring.

    <ol class="workflow">
      <li>
        <strong>Infrastructure Design:</strong> Planned AWS and Azure hybrid architecture,
        defining networking, security zones, and access controls.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server Deployment:</strong> Configured EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and
        reverse proxy routing.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Implementation:</strong> Deployed Snort, firewall rules, IDS/IPS,
        and authentication services.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Monitoring & Logging:</strong> Enabled traffic logging, alert generation,
        and automated ticket creation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Testing & Validation:</strong> Simulated user access, attacks, and failure
        scenarios.
